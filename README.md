# Data Science Project Suggestion for Beginner Student

## Project Title: Analyzing E-Commerce Sales Data

### Objective
This project aims to help you apply your Python and SQL skills to analyze a real-world e-commerce dataset, derive meaningful insights, and present your findings in a clear and professional manner. You will use Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, and SQL for querying and extracting specific data insights.

### Project Overview
You will work with an e-commerce sales dataset (e.g., a sample dataset from Kaggle, such as the "Online Retail Dataset"). The goal is to analyze customer purchasing patterns, identify top-selling products, and explore trends in sales data. This project will enhance your skills in data manipulation, querying, visualization, and reporting.

### Why This Project?
- **Python**: Practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **SQL**: Apply SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and extract insights from a relational database.
- **Real-World Relevance**: E-commerce data analysis is a common task in data science, making this project a great portfolio addition.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: The project is structured to be achievable with your current Python and SQL knowledge.

### Dataset
- **Source**: Use the "Online Retail Dataset" from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommercedata) or a similar e-commerce dataset. It contains transactional data with fields like InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.
- **Alternative**: If you prefer another dataset, choose one with similar attributes (e.g., sales, customers, products) from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Format**: The dataset is typically in CSV format, which you can load into Python using Pandas and into a SQL database (e.g., SQLite) for querying.

### Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Use Jupyter Notebook for coding.
  - **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations (if needed).
- **SQL**: Use SQLite (or MySQL/PostgreSQL) to create a database and run queries.
- **Optional**: Google Colab or VS Code for a cloud-based or local development environment.
- **Dataset Loading**: Use Python’s `sqlite3` library to load the CSV into an SQLite database for SQL practice.

### Project Steps

1. **Data Collection and Setup**
   - Download the dataset from Kaggle.
   - Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame in Python.
   - Create an SQLite database and import the CSV data into a table for SQL querying.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure (e.g., check columns, data types, and missing values).

2. **Data Cleaning (Python)**
   - Handle missing values (e.g., remove or impute missing CustomerID or Quantity).
   - Remove duplicates or invalid entries (e.g., negative quantities or prices).
   - Convert data types (e.g., InvoiceDate to datetime format).
   - Create new columns if needed (e.g., TotalPrice = Quantity * UnitPrice).

3. **SQL Queries**
   - Write SQL queries to answer questions like:
     - What are the top 5 products by total sales (Quantity * UnitPrice)?
     - Which country has the highest number of transactions?
     - What is the average order value per customer?
     - Identify sales trends by month or day of the week.
   - Example SQL query:
     ```sql
     SELECT Description, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) as TotalSales
     FROM sales
     GROUP BY Description
     ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

4. **Data Analysis (Python)**
   - Use Pandas to compute summary statistics (e.g., total sales, average order value).
   - Group data by country, product, or time period (e.g., monthly sales).
   - Identify trends, such as peak sales months or top customers by purchase frequency.

5. **Data Visualization (Python)**
   - Create visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn:
     - Bar chart of top 5 products by sales.
     - Line plot of sales trends over time (e.g., monthly sales).
     - Pie chart of sales distribution by country.
   - Example Python code for a bar chart:
     ```python
     import seaborn as sns
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     top_products = df.groupby('Description')['TotalPrice'].sum().nlargest(5)
     sns.barplot(x=top_products.values, y=top_products.index)
     plt.title('Top 5 Products by Total Sales')
     plt.xlabel('Total Sales')
     plt.ylabel('Product')
     plt.show()
     ```

6. **Insights and Reporting**
   - Summarize your findings in a short report (e.g., a Jupyter Notebook with markdown cells or a separate document).
   - Answer questions like:
     - Which products are most popular?
     - Are there seasonal trends in sales?
     - Which countries contribute the most to revenue?
   - Include visualizations and SQL query results in your report.
   - Suggest one actionable business recommendation based on your analysis (e.g., “Focus marketing on top-selling products in Country X”).

### Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Containing Python code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations, with markdown cells explaining your steps and findings.
- **SQL Script**: A `.sql` file with your SQL queries and their results.
- **Report**: A brief document (or markdown section in the notebook) summarizing insights, visualizations, and recommendations.
- **Optional**: A presentation slide deck (e.g., using PowerPoint or Google Slides) to showcase your findings.

### Learning Outcomes
- **Python**: Gain hands-on experience with Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
- **SQL**: Practice writing queries for filtering, grouping, and aggregating data.
- **Data Science Skills**: Learn to clean messy data, derive insights, and communicate findings effectively.
- **Portfolio Boost**: A completed project to showcase on GitHub or share with potential employers.

### Tips for Success
- **Start Small**: Focus on a few key questions (e.g., top products, sales by country) before exploring more complex analyses.
- **Document Your Work**: Use comments in your Python and SQL code to explain your logic.
- **Validate Results**: Double-check your SQL query results with Pandas to ensure accuracy.
- **Explore Further**: If comfortable, try advanced analyses like customer segmentation (e.g., grouping customers by purchase frequency).
- **Seek Help**: Use resources like Stack Overflow, Pandas documentation, or SQL tutorials if stuck.
